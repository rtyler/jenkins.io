= Pipeline Editor

The Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone wanting to get started with
creating Pipelines in Jenkins. It's also great way for advanced Jenkins users
to start adopting Pipeline.

The editor allows users to create and edit a Pipeline with different
stages and parallelized tasks that can run at the same time, depending on their
needs. After editing of the Pipeline is complete, the Pipeline can then be
saved into a source code repository as a `Jenkinsfile`.


If you ever need to change the Pipeline again,
Blue Ocean makes it easy to jump back in into the visual editor to modify the
Pipeline at any time, or you can change the Pipeline in code by editing the `Jenkinsfile` directly.
