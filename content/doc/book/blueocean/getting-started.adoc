= Starting with Blue Ocean

This section will show how to start using Blue Ocean.
It will include instructions for installing and configuring the Blue Ocean plugin,
and how to get switch into and out of the Blue Ocean UI.

== Installing

Blue Ocean can be installed in an existing Jenkins environment or be run
<<blueocean-docker, with Docker>>.

To start using the plugin:blue-ocean[Blue Ocean plugin] in an existing Jenkins
environment, it must be running Jenkins 2.7.x or later.:

. Login to your Jenkins server
. Click **Manage Jenkins** in the sidebar then **Manage Plugins**
. Choose the **Available** tab and use the search bar to find **Blue Ocean**
. Click the checkbox in the Install column
. Click either **Install without restart** or **Download now and install after
restart**

For in-depth description on how to install and manage plugins,
refer to the <<managing/plugins#, Managing Plugins>> section.

The majority of Blue Ocean requires no additional configuration after
installation.  Existing Pipelines and Jobs will continue to work as usual.
However, the first time a <<creating-pipelines, Pipeline is created>>, Blue
Ocean will ask for permissions to access your repositories (either Git or
GitHub) in order to create pipelines based on those repositories.

=== With Docker

The Jenkins project publishes a Docker container with Blue Ocean built-in every
time a new release of Blue Ocean is published. The `jenkinsci/blueocean`
image is based off of the current link:/download[Jenkins Long-Term Support]
(LTS) release and is production ready.

To start a new Jenkins with Blue Ocean pre-installed:

. Ensure Docker is installed.
. Run `docker run -p 8888:8080 jenkinsci/blueocean:latest`
. Browse to http://localhost:8888/blue

The Blue Ocean container can be configured using all the same
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#usage[configuration options] available
to the other images published by the Jenkins project.

== Starting Blue Ocean

Once a Jenkins environment has Blue Ocean installed, users can start using Blue
Ocean by clicking the **Open Blue Ocean** in the top navigation bar of the
Jenkins web UI. Alternatively, users can navigate directly to Blue Ocean at the
`/blue` URL for their Jenkins environment, for example
`http://JENKINS_URL/blue`.

=== Switching to the "Classic" UI

Blue Ocean may not support some legacy or administrative functions which are
necessary to some users. For those wishing to exit the Blue Ocean user
experience, an "exit" icon is located at the top of most pages in Blue Ocean.
Clicking the exit icon will navigate to the most relevant page in "classic"
which parallels the current page in Blue Ocean.

Some links in Blue Ocean, like **Administration**, will also navigate to the
classic web UI when there is no Blue Ocean equivalent.  In these cases, Blue
Ocean will automatically take the user into the classic web UI as necessary.
